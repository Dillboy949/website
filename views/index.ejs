												<h3>Compete in the First Tech Challenge!</h3>
												<p>What would robotics be without a goal to work towards? The First Tech Challenge is a competition that brings together teams from all around the country to compete in a theme-based game, usually based on current events! We spend about 1/2 of our year preparing for this, starting with Kickoff in September and the finals in late January, but you can find us at meets all over Oregon around November and December!</p>

												<h3>Learn Teamwork Through Fun, Interactive Projects!</h3>
												<p>As young students, we still have lots to learn, and cooperation is one big part. Today, the biggest advancements in science and technology are no longer done by individuals, but teams of people. We hope to bring these valuable teamwork skills to the competition and beyond!</p>

												<h3>Have Fun!</h3>
												<p>What better way to learn, than to be surrounded by supportive, like-minded team members in a casual and engaging environment. When it comes to robotics, this team's motto is, "Just bring yourself. We'll fill you in on the rest later." </p>
