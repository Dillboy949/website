											<h3>About Us</h3>
											<p>We are located at Southridge High School, in Beaverton, Oregon. At Southridge Robotics Club, we are dedicated to developing great skills and foster great friendships. Founded in 2021 with the goal of competing in the First Tech Challenge, we overcame many challanges faced by many entrepeneurs, broadening some of our other skills. We hope to be part of the 2022 First Tech Challenge and hope to see you at the competition!</p>
